There is a canonical\\ninjective map\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\label{equation-embedding-product}\\n\\\\text{Aut}(F)\\n\\\\longrightarrow\\n\\\\prod\\\\nolimits_{X \\\\in \\\\Ob(\\\\mathcal{C})} \\\\text{Aut}(F(X))\\n\\\\end{equation}\\nFor a set $E$ we endow $\\\\text{Aut}(E)$ with the compact open topology, see\\nTopology, Example \\\\ref{topology-example-automorphisms-of-a-set}.\\nOf course this is the discrete topology when $E$ is finite, which\\nis the case of interest in this section\\\\footnote{When we discuss the\\npro-\\\\'etale fundamental group the general case will be of interest.}.\\nWe endow $\\\\text{Aut}(F)$ with the topology induced from the\\nproduct topology on the right hand side of (\\\\ref{equation-embedding-product}).\\nIn particular, the action maps\\n$$\\n\\\\text{Aut}(F) \\\\times F(X) \\\\longrightarrow F(X)\\n$$\\nare continuous when $F(X)$ is given the discrete topology because this\\nis true for the action maps $\\\\text{Aut}(E) \\\\times E \\\\to E$ for any set $E$.\\nThe universal property of our topology on $\\\\text{Aut}(F)$ is the following:\\nsuppose that $G$ is a topological group and $G \\\\to \\\\text{Aut}(F)$\\nis a group homomorphism such that the induced actions $G \\\\times F(X) \\\\to F(X)$\\nare continuous for all $X \\\\in \\\\Ob(\\\\mathcal{C})$ where $F(X)$ has\\nthe discrete topology.

The map (\\\\ref{equation-embedding-product}) identifies\\n$\\\\text{Aut}(F)$ with a closed subgroup of\\n$\\\\prod_{X \\\\in \\\\Ob(\\\\mathcal{C})} \\\\text{Aut}(F(X))$.\\nIn particular, if $F(X)$ is finite for all $X$, then\\n$\\\\text{Aut}(F)$ is a profinite group.\\n\\\\end{lemma}\\n\\n\\\\begin{proof}\\nLet $\\\\xi = (\\\\gamma_X) \\\\in \\\\prod \\\\text{Aut}(F(X))$ be an element not in\\n$\\\\text{Aut}(F)$. Then there exists a morphism $f : X \\\\to X'$ of $\\\\mathcal{C}$\\nand an element $x \\\\in F(X)$ such that\\n$F(f)(\\\\gamma_X(x)) \\\\not = \\\\gamma_{X'}(F(f)(x))$.\\nConsider the open neighbourhood\\n$U = \\\\{\\\\gamma \\\\in \\\\text{Aut}(F(X)) \\\\mid \\\\gamma(x) = \\\\gamma_X(x)\\\\}$\\nof $\\\\gamma_X$ and the open neighbourhood\\n$U' = \\\\{\\\\gamma' \\\\in \\\\text{Aut}(F(X')) \\\\mid \\\\gamma'(F(f)(x)) =\\n\\\\gamma_{X'}(F(f)(x))\\\\}$.\\nThen\\n$U \\\\times U' \\\\times \\\\prod_{X'' \\\\not = X, X'} \\\\text{Aut}(F(X''))$\\nis an open neighbourhood of $\\\\xi$ not meeting $\\\\text{Aut}(F)$.\\nThe final statement is follows from the fact that\\n$\\\\prod \\\\text{Aut}(F(X))$ is a profinite space if each $F(X)$ is finite.\\n\\\\end{proof}\\n\\n\\\\begin{example}\\n\\\\label{example-galois-category-G-sets}\\nLet $G$ be a topological group. An important example will be the\\nforgetful functor\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\label{equation-forgetful}\\n\\\\textit{Finite-}G\\\\textit{-Sets} \\\\longrightarrow \\\\textit{Sets}\\n\\\\end{equation}\\nwhere $\\\\textit{Finite-}G\\\\textit{-Sets}$ is the full subcategory of\\n$G\\\\textit{-Sets}$ whose objects are the finite $G$-sets.\\nThe category $G\\\\textit{-Sets}$ of $G$-sets is defined in\\nDefinition \\\\ref{definition-G-set-continuous}.\\n\\\\end{example}\\n\\n\\\\noindent\\nLet $G$ be a topological group. The {\\\\it profinite completion} of $G$\\nwill be the profinite group\\n$$\\nG^\\\\wedge =\\n\\\\lim_{U \\\\subset G\\\\text{ open, normal, finite index}} G/U\\n$$\\nwith its profinite topology. Observe that the limit is cofiltered\\nas a finite intersection of open, normal subgroups of finite index\\nis another. The universal property of the profinite completion is\\nthat any continuous map $G \\\\to H$ to a profinite group $H$ factors\\ncanonically as $G \\\\to G^\\\\wedge \\\\to H$.\\n\\n\\\\begin{lemma}\\n\\\\label{lemma-single-out-profinite}\\nLet $G$ be a topological group. The automorphism group of the functor\\n(\\\\ref{equation-forgetful}) endowed with its profinite topology from\\nLemma \\\\ref{lemma-aut-inverse-limit} is the profinite completion of $G$.\\n\\\\end{lemma}\\n\\n\\\\begin{proof}\\nDenote $F_G$ the functor (\\\\ref{equation-forgetful}). Any morphism\\n$X \\\\to Y$ in $\\\\textit{Finite-}G\\\\textit{-Sets}$ commutes with the action\\nof $G$. Thus any $g \\\\in G$ defines an automorphism of $F_G$ and\\nwe obtain a canonical homomorphism $G \\\\to \\\\text{Aut}(F_G)$ of groups.\\nObserve that any finite $G$-set $X$ is a finite disjoint union of\\n$G$-sets of the form $G/H_i$ with canonical $G$-action where\\n$H_i \\\\subset G$ is an open subgroup of finite index. Then\\n$U_i = \\\\bigcap gH_ig^{-1}$ is open, normal, and has finite index.\\nMoreover $U_i$ acts trivially on $G/H_i$ hence\\n$U = \\\\bigcap U_i$ acts trivially on $F_G(X)$. Hence the action\\n$G \\\\times F_G(X) \\\\to F_G(X)$ is continuous. By the universal\\nproperty of the topology on $\\\\text{Aut}(F_G)$ the map\\n$G \\\\to \\\\text{Aut}(F_G)$ is continuous.\\nBy Lemma \\\\ref{lemma-aut-inverse-limit} and the universal property\\nof profinite completion there is an induced\\ncontinuous group homomorphism\\n$$\\nG^\\\\wedge \\\\longrightarrow \\\\text{Aut}(F_G)\\n$$\\nMoreover, since $G/U$ acts faithfully on $G/U$ this map is\\ninjective. If the image is dense, then the map is surjective and hence a\\nhomeomorphism by Topology, Lemma \\\\ref{topology-lemma-bijective-map}.\\n\\n\\\\medskip\\\\noindent\\nLet $\\\\gamma \\\\in \\\\text{Aut}(F_G)$ and let $X \\\\in \\\\Ob(\\\\mathcal{C})$.\\nWe will show there is a $g \\\\in G$ such that $\\\\gamma$ and $g$\\ninduce the same action on $F_G(X)$. This will finish the proof.\\nAs before we see that $X$ is a finite disjoint union of $G/H_i$.\\nWith $U_i$ and $U$ as above, the finite $G$-set $Y = G/U$\\nsurjects onto $G/H_i$ for all $i$ and hence it suffices to\\nfind $g \\\\in G$ such that $\\\\gamma$ and $g$ induce the same action\\non $F_G(G/U) = G/U$. Let $e \\\\in G$ be the neutral element and\\nsay that $\\\\gamma(eU) = g_0U$ for some $g_0 \\\\in G$. For any\\n$g_1 \\\\in G$ the morphism\\n$$\\nR_{g_1} : G/U \\\\longrightarrow G/U,\\\\quad gU \\\\longmapsto gg_1U\\n$$\\nof $\\\\textit{Finite-}G\\\\textit{-Sets}$ commutes with the action of\\n$\\\\gamma$. Hence\\n$$\\n\\\\gamma(g_1U) = \\\\gamma(R_{g_1}(eU)) = R_{g_1}(\\\\gamma(eU)) =\\nR_{g_1}(g_0U) = g_0g_1U\\n$$\\nThus we see that $g = g_0$ works.\\n\\\\end{proof}\\n\\n\\\\noindent\\nRecall that an exact functor is one which commutes with all\\nfinite limits and finite colimits. In particular such a functor\\ncommutes with equalizers, coequalizers, fibred products,\\npushouts, etc.\\n\\n\\\\begin{lemma}\\n\\\\label{lemma-second-fundamental-functor}\\nLet $G$ be a topological group. Let\\n$F : \\\\textit{Finite-}G\\\\textit{-Sets} \\\\to \\\\textit{Sets}$\\nbe an exact functor with $F(X)$ finite for all $X$.\\nThen $F$ is isomorphic to the functor (\\\\ref{equation-forgetful}).\\n\\\\end{lemma}\\n\\n\\\\begin{proof}\\nLet $X$ be a nonempty object of $\\\\textit{Finite-}G\\\\textit{-Sets}$.\\nThe diagram\\n$$\\n\\\\xymatrix{\\nX \\\\ar[r] \\\\ar[d] & \\\\{*\\\\} \\\\ar[d] \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\{*\\\\} \\\\ar[r] & \\\\{*\\\\}\\n}\\n$$\\nis cocartesian. Hence we conclude that $F(X)$ is nonempty.\\nLet $U \\\\subset G$ be an open, normal subgroup with finite index.\\nObserve that\\n$$\\nG/U \\\\times G/U = \\\\coprod\\\\nolimits_{gU \\\\in G/U} G/U\\n$$\\nwhere the summand corresponding to $gU$ corresponds to the orbit of\\n$(eU, gU)$ on the left hand side. Then we see that\\n$$\\nF(G/U) \\\\times F(G/U) = F(G/U \\\\times G/U) = \\\\coprod\\\\nolimits_{gU \\\\in G/U} F(G/U)\\n$$\\nHence $|F(G/U)| = |G/U|$ as $F(G/U)$ is nonempty. Thus we see that\\n$$\\n\\\\lim_{U \\\\subset G\\\\text{ open, normal, finite idex}} F(G/U)\\n$$\\nis nonempty (Categories, Lemma \\\\ref{categories-lemma-nonempty-limit}).\\nPick $\\\\gamma = (\\\\gamma_U)$ an element in this limit.\\nDenote $F_G$ the functor (\\\\ref{equation-forgetful}). We can identify\\n$F_G$ with the functor\\n$$\\nX \\\\longmapsto \\\\colim_U \\\\Mor(G/U, X)\\n$$\\nwhere $f : G/U \\\\to X$ corresponds to $f(eU) \\\\in X = F_G(X)$\\n(details omitted). Hence the element $\\\\gamma$ determines\\na well defined map\\n$$\\nt : F_G \\\\longrightarrow F\\n$$\\nNamely, given $x \\\\in X$ choose $U$ and $f : G/U \\\\to X$ sending\\n$eU$ to $x$ and then set $t_X(x) = F(f)(\\\\gamma_U)$.\\nWe will show that $t$ induces a bijective map\\n$t_{G/U} : F_G(G/U) \\\\to F(G/U)$ for any $U$.\\nThis implies in a straightforward manner that $t$\\nis an isomorphism (details omitted).\\nSince $|F_G(G/U)| = |F(G/U)|$ it suffices to show\\nthat $t_{G/U}$ is surjective. The image contains at least\\none element, namely\\n$t_{G/U}(eU) = F(\\\\text{id}_{G/U})(\\\\gamma_U) = \\\\gamma_U$.\\nFor $g \\\\in G$ denote $R_g : G/U \\\\to G/U$ right multiplication.\\nThen set of fixed points of $F(R_g) : F(G/U) \\\\to F(G/U)$\\nis equal to $F(\\\\emptyset) = \\\\emptyset$ if $g \\\\not \\\\in U$ because $F$\\ncommutes with equalizers. It follows that if\\n$g_1, \\\\ldots, g_{|G/U|}$ is a system of representatives\\nfor $G/U$, then the elements $F(R_{g_i})(\\\\gamma_U)$ are pairwise distinct\\nand hence fill out $F(G/U)$. Then\\n$$\\nt_{G/U}(g_iU) = F(R_{g_i})(\\\\gamma_U)\\n$$\\nand the proof is complete.\\n\\\\end{proof}\\n\\n\\\\begin{example}\\n\\\\label{example-from-C-F-to-G-sets}\\nLet $\\\\mathcal{C}$ be a category and let $F : \\\\mathcal{C} \\\\to \\\\textit{Sets}$\\nbe a functor such that $F(X)$ is finite for all $X \\\\in \\\\Ob(\\\\mathcal{C})$.\\nBy Lemma \\\\ref{lemma-aut-inverse-limit} we see that $G = \\\\text{Aut}(F)$\\ncomes endowed with the structure of a profinite topological group in a\\ncanonical manner. We obtain a functor\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\label{equation-remember}\\n\\\\mathcal{C} \\\\longrightarrow \\\\textit{Finite-}G\\\\textit{-Sets},\\\\quad\\nX \\\\longmapsto F(X)\\n\\\\end{equation}\\nwhere $F(X)$ is endowed with the induced action of $G$. This action\\nis continuous by our construction of the topology on $\\\\text{Aut}(F)$.\\n\\\\end{example}\\n\\n\\\\noindent\\nThe purpose of defining Galois categories is to single out those\\npairs $(\\\\mathcal{C}, F)$ for which the functor (\\\\ref{equation-remember})\\nis an equivalence. Our definition of a Galois category is as follows.\\n\\n\\\\begin{definition}\\n\\\\label{definition-galois-category}\\n\\\\begin{reference}\\nDifferent from the definition in \\\\cite[Expos\\\\'e V, Definition 5.1]{SGA1}.\\nCompare with \\\\cite[Definition 7.2.1]{BS}.\\n\\\\end{reference}\\nLet $\\\\mathcal{C}$ be a category and let $F : \\\\mathcal{C} \\\\to \\\\textit{Sets}$\\nbe a functor. The pair $(\\\\mathcal{C}, F)$ is a {\\\\it Galois category} if\\n\\\\begin{enumerate}\\n\\\\item $\\\\mathcal{C}$ has finite limits and finite colimits,\\n\\\\item\\n\\\\label{item-connected-components}\\nevery object of $\\\\mathcal{C}$ is a finite (possibly empty)\\ncoproduct of connected objects,\\n\\\\item $F(X)$ is finite for all $X \\\\in \\\\Ob(\\\\mathcal{C})$, and\\n\\\\item $F$ reflects isomorphisms and is exact.\\n\\\\end{enumerate}\\nHere we say $X \\\\in \\\\Ob(\\\\mathcal{C})$ is connected if\\nit is not initial and for any monomorphism $Y \\\\to X$\\neither $Y$ is initial or $Y \\\\to X$ is an isomorphism.\\n\\\\end{definition}\\n\\n\\\\noindent\\n{\\\\bf Warning:} This definition is not the same (although eventually we'll\\nsee it is equivalent) as the definition given in most references.\\nNamely, in \\\\cite[Expos\\\\'e V, Definition 5.1]{SGA1} a Galois category is\\ndefined to be a category equivalent to $\\\\textit{Finite-}G\\\\textit{-Sets}$\\nfor some profinite group $G$. Then Grothendieck characterizes\\nGalois categories by a list of axioms (G1) -- (G6) which are weaker\\nthan our axioms above. The motivation for our choice is to stress the\\nexistence of finite limits and finite colimits and exactness of the\\nfunctor $F$. The price we'll pay for this later is that we'll have\\nto work a bit harder to apply the results of this section.\\n\\n\\\\begin{lemma}\\n\\\\label{lemma-epi-mono}\\nLet $(\\\\mathcal{C}, F)$ be a Galois category. Let\\n$X \\\\to Y \\\\in \\\\text{Arrows}(\\\\mathcal{C})$. Then\\n\\\\begin{enumerate}\\n\\\\item $F$ is faithful,\\n\\\\item $X \\\\to Y$ is a monomorphism\\n$\\\\Leftrightarrow F(X) \\\\to F(Y)$ is injective,\\n\\\\item $X \\\\to Y$ is an epimorphism\\n$\\\\Leftrightarrow F(X) \\\\to F(Y)$ is surjective,\\n\\\\item an object $A$ of $\\\\mathcal{C}$ is initial if and only if\\n$F(A) = \\\\emptyset$,\\n\\\\item an object $Z$ of $\\\\mathcal{C}$ is final if and only if\\n$F(Z)$ is a singleton,\\n\\\\item if $X$ and $Y$ are connected, then $X \\\\to Y$ is an epimorphism,\\n\\\\item\\n\\\\label{item-one-element}\\nif $X$ is connected and $a, b : X \\\\to Y$ are two morphisms\\nthen $a = b$ as soon as $F(a)$ and $F(b)$ agree on one element of $F(X)$,\\n\\\\item if $X = \\\\coprod_{i = 1, \\\\ldots, n} X_i$ and\\n$Y = \\\\coprod_{j = 1, \\\\ldots, m} Y_j$ where $X_i$, $Y_j$ are connected,\\nthen there is map $\\\\alpha : \\\\{1, \\\\ldots, n\\\\} \\\\to \\\\{1, \\\\ldots, m\\\\}$\\nsuch that $X \\\\to Y$ comes from a collection of morphisms\\n$X_i \\\\to Y_{\\\\alpha(i)}$.\\n\\\\end{enumerate}\\n\\\\end{lemma}\\n\\n\\\\begin{proof}\\nProof of (1). Suppose $a, b : X \\\\to Y$ with $F(a) = F(b)$.\\nLet $E$ be the equalizer of $a$ and $b$. Then $F(E) = F(X)$\\nand we see that $E = X$ because $F$ reflects isomorphisms.\\n\\n\\\\medskip\\\\noindent\\nProof of (2). This is true because $F$ turns the morphism $X \\\\to X \\\\times_Y X$\\ninto the map $F(X) \\\\to F(X) \\\\times_{F(Y)} F(X)$ and $F$ reflects isomorphisms.\\n\\n\\\\medskip\\\\noindent\\nProof of (3). This is true because $F$ turns the morphism $Y \\\\amalg_X Y \\\\to Y$\\ninto the map $F(Y) \\\\amalg_{F(X)} F(Y) \\\\to F(Y)$ and $F$ reflects isomorphisms.\\n\\n\\\\medskip\\\\noindent\\nProof of (4). There exists an initial object $A$ and certainly\\n$F(A) = \\\\emptyset$. On the other hand, if $X$ is an object with\\n$F(X) = \\\\emptyset$, then the unique map $A \\\\to X$ induces a bijection\\n$F(A) \\\\to F(X)$ and hence $A \\\\to X$ is an isomorphism.\\n\\n\\\\medskip\\\\noindent\\nProof of (5). There exists a final object $Z$ and certainly\\n$F(Z)$ is a singleton. On the other hand, if $X$ is an object with\\n$F(X)$ a singleton, then the unique map $X \\\\to Z$ induces a bijection\\n$F(X) \\\\to F(Z)$ and hence $X \\\\to Z$ is an isomorphism.\\n\\n\\\\medskip\\\\noindent\\nProof of (6). The equalizer $E$ of the two maps $Y \\\\to Y \\\\amalg_X Y$ is not\\nan initial object of $\\\\mathcal{C}$ because $X \\\\to Y$ factors through $E$\\nand $F(X) \\\\not = \\\\emptyset$.
